#### Final Response

##### 1.
This week I started learned literally everything from the last month of class. While also utilizing the things I learned from the first part of the semester.

##### 2.
The assignment was incredibly challenging and as of right now it is incomplete as I can not get the ball to bounce or acknowledge my platform.

##### 3.
I had been working on this final for quite some time. I think since HW-3. I have utilized The Coding Train and worked hours with Quinn Bruderer learning new functions and repairing my messy and broken code.

##### 4.
The entire day has been spent learning new things and expanding on basic coding functions. Interesting but very tiring and mind numbing.

##### 5.
As I mentioned in question 3, I received in-person help from TA Quinn Bruderer on my previous assignments and on this final product. Very gracious to dedicate the time to assist me, as getting help from instructors with my time constrictions ended up being an issue.
