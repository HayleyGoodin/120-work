#### Week 12 Response

##### 1.
 I had issues with my code or this week and was not able to get help until December 12 along with HW-10 and the Final project for this class. I followed a tutorial by the Coding Train originally but there are outdated codes that he used that lead me astray but I am back on the right track now.

##### 2.
The assignment started out great I felt like I was understanding what I was learning only to find out the hardway that my code was simply not going to work with the code I was using. It was P5 but it was made for a P5 specific software, something like that.  

##### 3.
I used another Coding Train tutorial as I have with a majority of my assignments and exercises, I learn a lot better with demonstration and verbal explanation.

##### 4.
I learned several new things on this assignment and it was the most rewarding outcome seeing the colors and numbers working the way I wanted.

##### 5.
I great special thanks again from TA Quinn for all the help and clear explanation of the different functions and how some of these confusing codes are working. Also for helping me so close to the end of the semester when I felt like I was doomed.
