#### 1
This week we started to learn codes that allow you to create animated drawings. The math so far has not been overwhelmingly difficult but I am still learning basic codes.

I had to go back and review some of the most basic function but I will eventually memorize it. I went to the the p5.js reference website and looked at some of the other codes just as I have the previous week. I am still trying my best to remember the codes so I don't have to keep looking at references. The videos provided were incredibly helpful, the guy who demonstrates the codes and their uses is very enthusiastic and interesting to watch.

I didn't have too many issues with the assignment this week. The main thing is when I play with the code, a simple mistake can mess up the entire thing. All I had to do was go back into my code and identify the error and fix it.

I used skills that I learned in previous lessons, really there isn't a way around it since the previous lesson were the basics. I did learn animation coding in its most basic form

I haven't helped any classmates yet so far, but I do read through some issues people have on the forum and other students responses to them. Though I don't have any input. I have learned some things from reading what others have to say.
