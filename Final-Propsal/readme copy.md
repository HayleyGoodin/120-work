# Final Proposal

There is a little game I use to play online when I was in grade school where you move a mattress across the screen to catch the cats that are falling from the sky. I wish to recreate this concept.
Based on the skill level I have I plan to just have ellipses falling from the sky and a platform that follows the mouse to bounce them back up.
I know this will be a challenge because everything in this course has been a challenge and I have not quite figured out how most of the functions work.
Based on the amount of work and projects I have right now, I don't have a set schedule. Any available time I have I distribute to each class assignment accordingly. Though because this class is something I am struggling with I do give myself more time during the week to figure out how to do things.
