### Week 6 Responses



#### 1
This week we started to learn codes that allow you to change the loop in the draw function for algorithmic animated drawings. The math is not complicated to me, its the codes themselves, comprehending placement and purpose.

The content this week was so difficult for me to understand I had to seek p% website references but also search for code train guy videos to help me understand. He teaches the codes in a way thats super easy to follow and understand!

I really struggled this week, not just because the content was complex but my overall workload during the week hinders me from giving this class my full attention. I would have really liked to baby step this content more so I can really understand each aspect of it and create something I like rather than just test shapes to make sure its working.

I used skills I learned previous weeks but a majority of this weeks content is completely new. I almost felt as though I missed an entire lesson because the leap from week 5 to week 6 was so intense. Some of the videos provided on the site were frustrating only because they were talking about things we haven't covered yet as though I am suppose to already know them. I learned a lot from this week but I do not feel like I learned nearly as much as I was suppose to.

I haven't helped any classmates this week. When I went looking through the forum for help it seemed to only frustrate my process more. I sought help from one of the TA's and he really helped me out.
