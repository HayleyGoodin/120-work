### Week 8 Responses



#### 1
This week we were allowed to do whatever it was that we wanted to demonstrate out skills in coding. I attempted something that was much to difficult for me to accomplish and tried to seek help from one of the TAs. He told me that I should save that word for a different assignment and do something that was more at my current skill level.

The work was only difficult at the beginning since I was trying to dig into things that I didn't know anything about. But I was quick to start a new code that was more doable for my skill level. Its great practice for the basics.

If my assignment was not already so late I would have played with more of the techniques I learned before hand. Even after seeking help I was having a hard time, but I started over and produced a sketch as fast as I could. Hopefully I can return to my original idea by the end of the semester and complete it.

The sketch that is not being used in hw-8 code was not the original idea I had planned, it was one of the fast sketches that I was going to attempt. I wanted to do something spooky for halloween but my idea took an accidental morbid turn so I changed it up so people don't think I'm deranged.

I haven't helped any classmates this week but I have talked to one of the TAs for more advanced help for my coding struggles.
