### Week 3 Responses

#### 1
This week I learned how to create a code to display text and shapes and send them directly to an internet browser. I had to overcome some very frustrating obstacles learning these new programs: GitHubApp and Atom, but it definitely helped me to understand how these sources work.

#### 2
As for the regular assignment, I simply watched all of this weeks video tutorials and learned what I had to do in order to accomplish the required tasks necessary to complete this weeks homework.

#### 3
I have had a lot of issues organizing and pushing my repo files and folders to my GitHub. I had first googled for answers and when I found nothing I turned to the forum to ask my peers for help. I didn't find the answers there so I just started to mess around in the programs and figure it out for myself. I successfully figured out what to do and my repo is organized and functioning.

I personally think the class is moving at a very good pace, a lot of this is very overwhelming but I do not feel like I am overloaded with work. All topics covered as far as material and not sources is being covered.

#### 5
I haven't helped any classmates yet so far, but from what I learned trying to fix my own mess of files I feel I could help with some of these issues that I also faced.
