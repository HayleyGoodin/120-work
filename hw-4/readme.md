This week I really got to fully understand how to move things up and down (x, y) creatively to make shapes into an artistic design. Very simple design but a design nonetheless. Great practice exercise with these techniques.

I had to go back and review some of the most basic function but I will eventually memorize it. I went to the the p5.js reference website and looked at some of the other codes but they were too complex for me at this time.

I didn't have any issues with this assignment at all, this was the most interesting and fun one so far this semester. Definitely helpful in getting me to understand the codes and how they work more and make me interested to learn more.

I didn't learn anything new this week but instead got to really sit down and use the things talked about the last few weeks. It was very helpful and fun.

I haven't helped any classmates yet so far, this weeks students talked about windows and a study group but nothing that I had any input on.
